I am Kelly Crabb√©, a 36 yo DevOps Engineer from Belgium. Boring, I know. I started out as a Service Desk Engineer and moved up the ranks as SysAdmin over at [MS Amlin](http://www.msamlin.com). Yep, that would be an insurance company. It gets more boring, I know. 
But hey, I am a gamer at heart, though most of my adventures now stop at playing some Facebook game. My time goes into working, learning and mostly into my lovely family. 

I also happen to be a lesbian, although the label may not be suitable completely either. I am physically attracted to women, but it's the fluid personality that draws me in all the way. And oh god, yes I have been drawn in - completely with my entire body and soul. 

So what does that make me? A gay DevOps chick? Ok, we can deal with that. 

I also am into photography? Urban Exploration - which is exploring and photographing urban decay.
