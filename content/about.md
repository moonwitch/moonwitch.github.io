I am Kelly Crabb√©, an almost 40 yo DevOps Engineer from Belgium. Boring, I know. I started out as a Service Desk Engineer and moved up the ranks as SysAdmin. I loved using Powershell to automate the tasks I hated doing; the boring stuff. Think of reading through backup logs, creating Active Directory accounts or handling the user accounts and info of people who were leaving the company. I feel if a task is following a predefined flow, that flow can be automated. So, that is how I ended up in the more DevOps side of the work. I am still more Ops than Dev, but one day!

Anyhow, I am a gamer at heart, though most of my adventures now stop at playing some Facebook game. My time goes into working, learning and mostly into my lovely family. Since I completely lack the time to play World Of Warcraft, I do open up Diablo III, a little bit of FallOut and occasionally a little dabble into Civilization V or VI. 

I also happen to be a lesbian, although the label may not be suitable completely either. I am physically attracted to women, but it's the fluid personality that draws me in all the way. And oh god, yes I have been drawn in - completely with my entire body and soul. I regret not having realized all of this earlier in life. It would have saved me so much time; and would have meant we (My wife and I) would be further along our chosen path. 

So what does that make me? A gay DevOps chick? Ok, we can deal with that. I may be weird, but we all have our issues ;)

I also am into photography? Urban Exploration - which is exploring and photographing urban decay.
