At work, I've been using [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/open-source) for a few projects; or rather one of my colleagues introduced Rundeck to us and as new kid on the team, I was suggested to work with it. My assignment was fairly simple; though without prior knowledge on Rundeck, it was a learning curve. 

### The assignment

Allow a user to select which service(s) to restart/start/stop on various selectable environments. 
Ensure puppet is also stopped if the selected action is stop. 

### The solution

_Bear in mind that this was my ***first*** assignment related to Rundeck._

#### Requirements

This entire thing hinges on tags; if you don't have nodes with tags, ***stop here*** and go tag your nodes properly.

- 'Details'-tab:
	- Enter a Job Name 'Start/Stop/Restart services on non-production servers'
    - In the textbox next to the Job Name, you can enter an extra folder; I added 'Non-Production'.
- 'Workflow'-tab:
	- Header 'Options'
    	- Click add an Option
        	- Option Type : Text
            - Option Name : environment
            - Option Label: Server Environment
            - Description : Select which environment you wish to work with; the correct servers will be selected based on this.
            - Default Value : Leave empty unless you want a default.
            - Input Type : Plain Text
            - Allowed Values : Check 'List' and enter the environments EXACTLY as they are added as tags to nodes in Rundeck.
            - Sort Values : Whatever floats your boat here; but note the _delimiter_ as this can make or break your entire setup.
            - Restrictions : Depending on what you want, I would definately go with 'Enforcred from Allowed Values' here.
            - Required: Yes
            - Should be hidden: In this case; No.
            - Multi-Valued : For the environments, No, for the services, Yes.
            - Click 'Save'.
       - Add another Option, this time:
       	- Option Name : services
        - Option Label : Selected Services
        - Option Description : Select which services you which to action. 
        - Multi-Valued : Yes.
