I've recently changed employer; I swapped insurance for transport. I went from MS Amlin to Lineas; I now help drive a 'Freight Force'. Lineas is fairly scattered right now; but it offers me so much potential growth. A new job also means learning new things; a lot of new things. 

Right now I am taking a Udemy course to obtain my *AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner* certification in addition to learning Ansible, Puppet with Terraform. I opted for the course by [Stephane Maarek](https://www.udemy.com/user/stephane-maarek/); namely the [Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/) 

I am currently wrestling through the entire IAM chapter. Although wrestling is a bit overstating it; Stephane explains it so easy. Even the new concepts are fairly clear, and if it baffles me - I generally get it thanks to the hands-on training as well. While I am going through the course, I also understand some stuff [Ben Corin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bencorin) was mentioning. He's one of the AWS guys at work.
